This a simple WPF application which allows to calculate increasing of damage to
any character which reached at least 80 level in World of Warcraft
on the basis of input data (armor value and armor penetration %).
The output data is the:
- decreasing of physical damage before armor penetration;
- residue of armor after penetration;
- decreasing of physical damage after armor penetration;
- the difference of physical damage after armor penetration;
